- If there's already an issue for the bug, **do not open another one**, and add on to the existing issue instead. You
  are free to add more details about the bug, this way we can more easily patch bugs.
- If the bug is limited to a specific branch (e.g. main, dev), please say so in the description.
- If you're reporting bugs that happen when other themes/mods conflict with Natsumi, please do NOT open bug reports for
  them.

## Suggesting a feature

## Contributing code
If you wish to contribute your code to the project, please **fork the repository**, add your changes to your fork, then
open a Pull request.
- If your PR fixes a bug or addresses a feature request, please reference the relevant issues. This way, people (including
  us) can know if we need to do work to fix an issue, or if we just need to merge a PR.
- Please make sure you've tested your code. Include screenshots/screen recordings in the PR so we know how your changes
  will work.
- **Do not attempt to add support for any browser Natsumi intentionally does not support.** Natsumi does not support such
  browsers either due to significant compatibility issues, poor reputation or stances against Natsumi's core values.
